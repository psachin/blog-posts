* Realtek 5129 USB Card Reader Controller

The post describes how to enable Realtek RTS5129 Card Reader
controller in Linux kernel.

Strangle I never came across this problem of SD-card not been
supported on Linux. At the beginning I thought it may be a hardware
problem but hey I just bought a new Laptop!. I needed to burn an image
on the SD-card as soon as I inserted a SD card adapter, the OS was not
able to detect it. I went ahead and checked =dmesg= log but no luck.
OK! that's fine, I checked =lspci= output but still not trace of Card
Reader Controller. May be the controller is not attached to PCI bus. I
fired =lsusb= and voila! I got an entry. The output had a reference of
Card Reader Controller.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#+END_SRC

This proved that the Card Reader Controller was attached to USB bus
and Linux kernel(My kernel was 3.16.1) had support for it but may be
few user-space modules are missing. So I downloaded the source code
for the latest kernel(Version 3.19.0) and searched for the string
'RTS' in Linux kernel configuration.

I ignored MFD_RTSX_PCI and enabled MFD_RTSX_USB from Device Drivers ->
Multifunctional device drivers -> Realtek USB Card Reader as module.

I recompiled the kernel and inserted SD-card. Nothing showed up in
=dmesg= log. I loaded the module manually using the command

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  modprobe rtsx_usb
#+END_SRC

But still the SD-card was not detected. Something was still missing. I
went ahead and searched the Linux kernel config for
'MMC'(MultiMediaCard) and two familiar modules showed up.

#+Name: Linux kernel 3.19.0. Result of 'MMC'

Again I safely ignored MMC_REALTEK_USB and enabled MMC_REALTEK_USB
from Device Drivers -> MMC/SD/SDIO card support -> Realtek USB SD/MMC
Card interface Driver as module.

#+CAPTION: Enable MMC_REALTEK_USB
#+Name: Enable MMC_REALTEK_USB

[[./rtsx_usb/realtek_usb_sd-mmc_card_interface_driver.png]]

I compiled the kernel again and inserted the SD-card. This time the
SD-card got successfully detected.

Support for Realtek USB card reader is [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/730876be256603b4ee7225a125467d97a7ce9060][patched]] into the Linux kernel
3.15 since Mar 19, 2014.

PS: The module =rtsx_usb= should load automatically. If the module is
not able to load, create a file rtsx_usb.conf in the path
/etc/modules-load.d with following content.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Load rtsx_usb.ko on boot This module is used to mount sdccard(mmc)
  # for Realtek RTS5129 Card Reader Controller. You need to enable
  # CONFIG_MDF_RTSX_USB and MMC_REALTEK_USB in kernel.
  rtsx_usb
#+END_SRC
